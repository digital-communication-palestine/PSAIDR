Personal Artificial Intelligence Doctor Our solution utilizes Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in order to accomplish its goals. The main ML concept used is the Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically word embedding word2vec method. The idea is to build a word2vec model using medical text such as academic books, clinics archive, and web content such as Wikipedia and other medical oriented websites. Such matrix will contain a significant amount of knowledge regarding symptoms and diseases, however unstructured, therefor, this word2vec model will be used as keystone to constructing a three clusters, symptoms cluster, diseases cluster, and best practices cluster, Afterwords, a sim-supervised approach consisting of manually creating the clusters with a specialist doctor help then update the clusters to the full amount of available information using the word2vec model. However our solution have more functions using ML such as audio and image classification, simply the user will record there voice or capture an image using the mobile app and the solution will classify the data as healthy or not health using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for audio, and Convolutional Neural Network CNN for image classification.
